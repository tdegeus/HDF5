Notes for developers

Make changes / additions
========================

Be sure to run the verification code in ``develop/``! All existing checks should pass, while new check should be added to check new functionality.

The `Catch <http://catch-lib.net>`_ library has been used to run the checks, it should be used also for all new checks. To compile the checks:

1.  Download and install Catch.

2.  Compile all test cases.

    .. code-block:: bash

      $ clang++ `pkg-config --cflags Eigen3 HDF5pp` -std=c++14 -Wpedantic -Wall -o test *.cpp

3.  Run ``./test``.

Python
======

The Python package of this module ``HDF5pp/__init__.py`` is essentially used to allow distribution of the header files that constitute this library through PyPi. In addition a small Python package *HDF5pp* is provided that allows easy ``setup.py`` formulations of derived packages. These features can also be used when one is just interested in using *pybind11* and one does not intend to use *HDF5pp* itself.

Create a new release
====================

1.  Update the version numbers as follows:

    -   Modify ``__version__ = ...`` in ``setup.py``.
    -   Modify ``set(HDF5pp_VERSION_NUMBER ...)`` in ``CMakeLists.txt``

2.  Upload the changes to GitHub and create a new release there (with the correct version number).

3.  Upload the package to PyPi:

    .. code-block:: bash

      $ python3 setup.py bdist_wheel --universal
      $ twine upload dist/*
