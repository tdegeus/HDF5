HDF5pp
******

This header-only module provides a very simple interface to store data to a HDF5-file. It's usage, programmatically and from a compilation perspective, is really simple. One just has to include the relevant header file and tell your compiler where it is located (and to the C++14 or younger standard). Really, that's it!
